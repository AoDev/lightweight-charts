The first thing you need to do to use `lightweight-charts` is to install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

`npm install --save lightweight-charts`

### Using a standalone version

The npm package is shipped with [a standalone version](https://unpkg.com/lightweight-charts@latest/dist/lightweight-charts.standalone.production.js).
It puts all exports from `esm` version to `window.LightweightCharts` object and can be used, for example, in [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) or in similar services.
